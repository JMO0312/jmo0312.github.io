        "abstract": "Let G be a finite connected graph. Two players, called cop C and robber R, play a game on G according to the following rules. First C then R occupy some vertex of G. After that they move alternately along edges of G. The cop C wins if he succeeds in putting himself on top of the robber R, otherwise R wins. We review an algorithmic characterization and structural description due to Nowakowski and Winkler. Then we consider the general situation where n cops chase the robber. It is shown that there are graphs on which arbitrarily many cops are needed to catch the robber. In contrast to this result, we prove that for planar graphs 3 cops always suffice to win.",

The cops and robbers game is a type of pursuit-evasion game played on graphs, and its variant is a very fruitful research area in graph theory. The purpose of this paper is to find the specific relations between pursuit-evasion game applications and different types of variants of the cops and robbers game. The research method is to find variants with different game rules and winning strategies and classify them. Then compare these rules and strategies with the applications of pursuit-evasion games to find their relationships. The comparison result shows that there are many differences between the variants and the applications, which lead to their inability to be directly related. The application of the pursuit-evasion game is mainly based on route planning and object distance, and generally contains multiple variant types, which is different from the current research direction of variant.",

The cop number of G is the minimum number of cops that is sufficient to catch the robber. Every planar graph has cop number at most three, and there are planar graphs for which three cops are necessary [Aigner and Fromme, DAM 1984]. We study the problem for beyond-planar graphs, that is, graphs that can be drawn in the plane with few crossings. In particular, we focus on 1-planar graphs, that is, graphs that can be drawn in the plane with at most one crossing per edge. In contrast to planar graphs, we show that some 1-planar graphs have unbounded cop number. Meanwhile, for maximal 1-planar graphs, we prove that three cops are always sufficient and sometimes necessary. In addition, we characterize outer 1-planar graphs with respect to their cop number.",

In this game, a set of cops and a robber occupy the vertices of the graph and move alternately along the graph\u2019s edges with perfect information about each other\u2019s positions. If a cop eventually occupies the same vertex as the robber, then the cops win; the robber wins if she can indefinitely evade capture. Aigner and Fromme established that in every connected planar graph, three cops are sufficient to capture a single robber. In this paper, we consider a recently studied variant of the cops and robbers game, alternately called the one-active-cop game, one-cop-moves game or the lazy cops and robbers game, where at most one cop can move during any round. We show that Aigner and Fromme\u2019s result does not generalize to this game variant by constructing a connected planar graph on which a robber can indefinitely evade three cops in the one-cop-moves game.",

        "abstract": "This paper surveys the similarities and differences between the game of cops and robbers and classes of related games. The game of cops and robbers is a class of pursuit\u2013evasion games played on a finite graph. The players comprise a set of cops and a robber located on vertices of the graph, and they move alternately along edges of the graph. The cops win the game if at least one cop occupies the same vertex of the robber in finite time; otherwise, the robber wins. Quilliot (Jeux de points fixes sur les graphes, These de 3ieme Cycle, Universite de Paris VI, Paris, pp 131\u2013145, 1978) and Nowakowski and Winkler (Discrete Math 43:235\u2013239, 1983) were among the first to study this class of games. The main questions studied in the literature of cops and robbers games are on the class of graphs that characterize cop-win games, on the minimum number of cops needed for classes of graphs to be cop-win, on a conjecture due Meyniel (Personal communication, 1985) about the cop number of a graph and more recently on the game played on random and/or infinite graphs (Bonato and Nowakowski in The game of cops and robbers, Student mathematical library, vol 61, American Mathematical Society, Providence, 2010; Bonato and Pralat in Graph searching games and probabilistic methods, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2017). While the game of cops and robbers is not traditionally modeled in the language of extensive game theory (Kuhn, in: Kuhn, Tucker (eds) Contributions to the theory of games II, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1953), Kehagias et al. (The role of visibility in pursuit/evasion games, 2014) give a general framework for the game of cops and robbers that relate to extensive games. By using the notion of \u201ccapture time,\u201d they are able to represent the game using a standard discrete dynamic game model with explicit payoff functions for the cops and the robber. More recently, the game of cops and robbers has also been related to dynamic games with state variables (Bonato and Macgillivray in Contrib Discrete Math, 2017) and discounted stochastic games (Konstantinidis and Kehagias in Selfish cops and adversarial robber: multi-player pursuit evasion on graphs, 2017a, arXiv:1703.07695; Theor Comput Sci 680:25\u201335, 2017b). In this survey, we study these connections.",
